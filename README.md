# Flowers-with-Transfer-Learning


Apply transfer learning to create your own CNN to classify images of flowers. You will have to download the Flowers dataset yourself using TensorFlow Datasets and split it into a training and validation set. At the end of the Colab we encourage you to perform transfer learning using the Inception model and compare the accuracy of this model with MobileNet.
